## SolidJS Basics Template

This is basically one of the default templates of SolidJS
with a `eslint` and `prettier` setup. The `package.json` was also typed as module.

#### Original Template

You can find template repos for SolidJS here

- https://github.com/solidjs/templates

I started it like this:

```bash
bunx degit solidjs/templates/ts-router my-solid-project
```

## How to Run

```bash
$ bun install
$ bun dev
```
